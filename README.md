## Cloning the repository

This repository makes use of the [Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Make sure to install it before you continue. It can replace large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise. We consider the following files with the extensions in the `static folder` as large files: `.scmap` and `.dds`.

```bash
# if you do not have lfs installed
$ git lfs install

# clone as usual
$ git lfs clone
```
